    <p>
   d3 select allows elements to be selected in order to do something with them. That can range from changing style, modifying their 
   attributes, performing data-joins or inserting and removing elements. D3 has two functions to make selections d3.select and
   d3.selectAll. d3.select will select the first matching element while selectAll will grab all matching elements. Select is just 
   the base and after each given element has been slected we can use others commands i'm about to talk about to specifically edit
   and or add to each element.
