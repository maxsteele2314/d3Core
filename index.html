   Select Command
  </h3
  
    <p>
   d3 select allows elements to be selected in order to do something with them. That can range from changing style, modifying their 
   attributes, performing data-joins or inserting and removing elements. D3 has two functions to make selections d3.select and
   d3.selectAll. d3.select will select the first matching element while selectAll will grab all matching elements. Select is just 
   the base and after each given element has been slected we can use others commands i'm about to talk about to specifically edit
   and or add to each element. The three specific commands are as listed below:
  </p>
  
   <h4>
   Append Command
  </h4>
  
    <p>
    Elements can be added to a selection using .append and .insert. .append appends an element to the children of each element 
     in the selection. The first argument specifies the type of element that we want to select. .append is commonly used in the
     context of enter/exit where it has different behaviour. Here's an example of this function:
     d3.selectAll('g.item')
  .append('text')
  .text(function(d, i) {
    return i + 1;
  });
  </p>
  
   <h4>
   Text Command
  </h4>
  
    <p>
     The .text command does just as we would expect and edits a given elements text. An example of this would look like 
     d3.select('div.title').text('My new book'). 
  </p>
  
  <h4>
   Style Command
  </h4>
  
    <p>
    The style command is similiar in its simplicity as it edits the style of an elemet. It somewhat acts as a CSS inside
     the actual function. CSS can still be added but the style command allows the return functions to be edited immediately and 
     more efficently. An example of this would be d3.selectAll('circle').style('fill', 'red').
